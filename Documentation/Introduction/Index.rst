Introduction
============

What does it do?
================
wacon_cookie_management(WCM) is a TYPO3 extension that enables website owner to comply to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in terms of the usage of cookies an the inclusion of external ressources. The Plugin displays a cookie consent box whenever the permission of a website visitor is necessary (so called "opt-in" method), saves the settings and generates a cookie to identify the user in further page requests.

Types of cookies
================
If you run a website you have to consider at least two types of cookies:

- **necessary cookies** are those which are essential for a website to run properly (e.g. session cookies for a shopping cart or a password protected login area)
- **non-essential cookies** like tracking or third party cookies. These cookies are usually not necessary (in a technical sense) to run a website  and are therefore subject to approval.

Most common external ressources
================
Ask the website visitor for consent BEFORE you use: 

- social media plugins (e.g. "timelines")
- Google Maps
- external fonts (we recommend to install fonts locally)
- YouTube videos
- all other services included via iframe from an external server
